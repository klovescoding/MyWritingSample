        <p id ="writeup">In this project, I was tasked with redesigning a website—LL Shop—to address user pain points. LL Shop is a plant website that has a certain playfulness that draws the customer in. This website is simple and very straightforward, so addressing users’ pain points by redesigning the website wasn’t too complicated. Although my redesign of LL Shop involved color changes to match competitors, the original website colors definitely give this website a flair that is all its own. 


          <br> <br>
<h4>PROBLEM</h4>
The users of the LL Shop's website were having issues easily navigating the website. The lack of consistency and difficulty in readability made it frustrating for users to navigate the website.

          <br> <br>

<h4>GOAL</h4>
My goal with the redesign of LL Shop is to allow users to navigate the website without having to guess what to do next. I am also redesigning the website to ensure accessibility along with readability. 


   
          <br> <br>

<h4>PROCESS</h4>
I started the redesign process by having five participants navigate the LL Shop website. The participants reported having trouble removing items from the cart because of not having clear directions on how to do so. They also reported wanting text input boxes to be outlined and better readability.
<br><br>
I completed a heuristic evaluation and competitive analysis. These were helpful in understanding what LL Shop could improve based on established principles. I also conducted cart sorts and tree testing, which gave an understanding of how users grouped items together.
<br><br>
I then created three personas, a journey map, and a site map. These were all helpful in further understanding the user who would be using the LL Shop website and the path they would take while navigating the website.
<br><br>
Sketches and wireframes were created. A low-fidelity prototype was created and used for usability testing based on the redesign of the website. A medium-fidelity prototype was also created and used for further testing on the redesign of the website. 


          <br> <br>
<h4>NEXT STEPS</h4>
A high-fidelity prototype will be created and usability testing will be conducted. Accessibility testing will also be done to ensure the website is inclusive and user-friendly for all.

          <br> <br>

<h4>TAKEAWAYS</h4>
LL Shop is a simple website that is overall easy to navigate. There are just a few tweaks that if done, will make using and purchasing plants an enjoyable experience for the user. I look forward to continued work on the redesign of the LL Shop website, developing a high-fidelity prototype, and conducting usability and accessibility testing.  </p>
